 - Monoids
 - Altenatives
 - Default implementation of LiftA and LiftA2 if either is missing
 - constructors for applicative/monad types should accept any types
     that construct the applicative/monad types, not just the embedded
     type. (eg `returnM<std::optional,int>(std::nullopt)` should work)
